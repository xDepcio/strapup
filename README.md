### Instalation
`npm i strapup -g` - install globally to be able to paste and save your templates anywhere.

### Basic use
`strapup` - Opens up interactive CLI. Follow on-screen informations to save/paste templates and more.

At the first use you must specify path where strapup will create its directory and store your templates and scripts. When you update or re-install strapup. Path to this directory may be lost, but directory itself is not deleted, you will just need to specify path to it again.
