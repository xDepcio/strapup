#### How to run It?
To run the Strapup CLI from anywhere on your system, just use:
```command
npx strapup
```
This will install required dependencies and correctly setup your enviroment on the first run.

#### Running for the first time
When you run Strapup for the first time, it will need to perform some setup. For this, you will be asked to provide:
- Path where to create Strapup directory - used to store templates and scripts.

Strapup saves those values in enviroment variables, so on next runs you don't have to provide them again.
