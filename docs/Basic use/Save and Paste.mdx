#### How to run It?
To run the Strapup CLI from anywhere on your system, just use:
```command
npx strapup
```
This will install required dependencies and correctly setup your enviroment on the first run.

#### Running for the first time
When you run Strapup for the first time, it will need to perform some setup. For this, you will be asked to provide:
- Path where to create Strapup directory - used to store templates and scripts.

Strapup saves those values in enviroment variables, so on next runs you don't have to provide them again.

#### Saving and pasting templates
You can save and create templates from within interactive CLI (`npx strapup`).

When you **paste** a template, you will be asked to:
- Choose a template.
- Provide path where to paste - template content will be paste there. Must be a relative path to a directory. If a directory doesn't exist, strapup will be created.

When you **save** a template, you will be asked to provide:
- Template name and description - used solely for identification purpose.
- Relative path or paths to source directories or files.
- Choose additional `options`:
    - `with gitignore` - If selected, files ignored by git will not be included in the template.
